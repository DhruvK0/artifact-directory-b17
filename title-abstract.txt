Title:
PropChain: A Blockchain-Based Framework for Automated
Property Transfers and Smart Contract Integration


Abstract:
Real estate transactions traditionally involve complex, time-consuming pro-
cesses that require multiple intermediaries, extensive paperwork, and pro-
longed settlement periods, resulting in increased costs and inefficiencies for
all parties involved. Although previous attempts to digitize real estate trans-
actions have improved document management and communication, they have
failed to address the fundamental issues of trust, transparency, and the need
for centralized intermediaries in the transaction process. Our research demon-
strates how blockchain technology and smart contracts can transform prop-
erty transactions by creating a decentralized, trustless system that automates
property transfers between buyers and sellers while maintaining legal com-
pliance and transaction security. The proof of concept implements common
real estate actions in a distributed ledger, such as title search, property trans-
fers, and property reviews. The system is also connected to sample banking
and escrow services through back-end servers to simulate loan processing and
escrow holding for properties. In addition, an authentication system is set up
to allow an internal ERC-20 coin to be awarded for user actions, such as prop-
erty verification. Finally, in order to showcase the viability of this system, the
interface has been created in a way that is compatible for both computer and
mobile users, reducing friction to using the service.
